My guess is that it's an operator-selectable option, since
4-way and 8-way joysticks typically use the same hardware.
An 8-way joystick has four switches - you get the diagonal
directions by using combinations of two switches (e.g
you go northeast when the north and east switches are both
depressed).

So ask your local arcade operator - maybe he/she can just
flip a switch for you somewhere...

Yup.  Lots 'o' good those keys have done me...

My feeling is that there's a "right" way to go through the rooms on a
level, because if you just proceed, say, directly to the "money" room,
you aren't given a chance to hit all the rooms on that level.  At
least that's what I've found.  I thought that it might be possible to
find the "pattern" (i.e., exit right, then up, then down, then ...)
for each level and thereby hit every room.  But I haven't put a lot of
time into that yet, so I don't know.

  I work in an arcade and we have SMASH TV.  Our machine runs with
all joysticks in 8 way mode.  There is a difficulty screen where you
can adjust how hard the game is.  Ours is set to normal which allows
8 way movement.  I suspect that the hard setting restricts it to 4 way
movement.  You can ask the operator to set it back to normal (the 
factory default) instead of harder (he had to of set it up this way).

I was playing Smash TV the other day, and I think I've come across a bug.

I had just died while fighting "scarface", and was getting ready to
start my next game.  I let the timer expire (by accident) and the
"NO WAY" voice sounded.  At the same time, I had inserted my quarter and
pressed start.

My game started over (as I had feared), but there was a 2x2 inch piece
of scarface following me around on the screen !  He even fired his
"eyes" at me and I died !  It was a very difficult room with the 
green men coming at me, as well as the scarface mutant.  Needless to say
I was quickly out of men, and I let the game end on purpose this time.

When I started up again, all was normal.  Anyone else see this effect ?

The search for the hidden rooms continues...

Nope, but I've seen lot's 'o' bugs in other places.  A favorite (and
recurring) one is where you're playing two-player and start a new
round.  Normally both players walk past the studio audience to the
playfield, but frequently you'll only see one, with the other just
magically appearing after play has started.  I don't know what causes
it, though.

Rollergames looks to have a few bugs, too.  I've had the game just
lock-up on me -- though play continued.  All the lights turned on and
the game sounded the digitized bell you hear when you first turn on
Williams pins.  Then all returned to normal.  There's another bug that
involves "The Pit"; when you turn on ball locking and then hit the
ball into the pit right away, it gets confused while it's doing its
"Don't Flip!" routine.  But things get back to normal shortly.

I can sympathize with the programmers for Rollergames, though.
There's so much shit going on, I'm surprised things work at all.
Rollergames has some of the most impressive playfield animation
(lights and sounds) that I've ever seen (better even then F14 Tomcat).

>The search for the hidden rooms continues...

And continues...  I'm getting ready to call Williams and ask if they
have a hint book or something...  :-)

At that point my friend Shaun did the most brilliant (and lucky) thing.
He headed for the point marked 'x'.  I was in deep trouble in the center just
waiting for him to bail me out.  He was running from robots and
Poof.....

Everything went weird and at the top of the screen it said something like
"Key activated, warp #3"  And next thing you know it was totaling the bonus for
that level and we were off to battling those little snake weaklings
(room after ScarFace).

Of course we tried to do it again to get to the Pleasure Dome but
no go.... ;-(

I tried this.  Just got myself killed.  No extra keys, no free men.
When do you guy's get your free men?  The first one for us appears
in the Party/Treasure Room and the next one soon after....

The difficulty setting on the machine here has changed, and this no
longer works for me either.  It used to be 4 on a scale of 1 to 10
(normal difficulty), now it feels like 6.  If you're on good terms with
your arcade's operator, con him into setting it at 1 (extra easy)...
it's a totally different game.

Also, is there any significance to the deviations the game host makes
from the usual speech?  I.e.,

"Good luck, you'll need it!"   --->   "Total carnage, I love it!"
"I'll buy that for a dollar!"  --->   "Good luck, you'll need it!"

Does this mean there's a warp in Total Carnage?  Nah....

Yeah, after finishing the game with sweat dripping off me, I noticed some 
interesting people who helped develop the game. One name that rang a bell
was Mark Turmell. Was he a C-64 game programmer once? I believe he programmed
for Sirius Software or Activision once. Is my memory correct. If so, it
seems that there's still room for others with comparably humble beginnings
to do well in the game industry...

Any opinions about how an implementation of NARC or Smash TV would do for
the IBM/compatible domain? Any ideas on how to program such beastly games
so that they are actually playable? I've heard that NARC for the NES plays
good. I haven't seen any discussion of it here. If you have anything
to say on this stuff. I'd love to hear from you. Please email rather
than post. If you want me to forward any responses, just ask...

No, but I'm getting real close.  There is, you know, someone who
frequents this group and who worked at Williams (or possibly still
works there).  But he's taken a vow of silence about this issue.
Perhaps if we each forward one of those annoying chain letters that
have been floating around the net to his mailbox...  :-)

Anyone feel like calling Eugene Jarvis on behalf of this newsgroup and
asking?  It's possibly less audacious than it sounds -- after all,
Steve Ritchie includes a note with his Black Knight 2000 pinball
machine that says (more or less) "call if you have questions about the
machine or if you just want to chat... we're real proud of it".

I've certainly run out of ideas (and quarters); to be honest, the
game's lost some of its charm and novelty for me, and I don't play it
as much as I used to.  Knowing the secret would definitely help revive
my interest (at least I'd have something to play for again -- though
trying to finish the second level on one quarter has been a pretty
unattainable goal so far).

Well, there's always Chicago information.  How many "Jarvis, E"
listings could there be?  :-)

I don't know of any but the direct Williams number.  I have no idea
what happens if you call and ask for Mr. Jarvis.  I assume you get
transferred at least one step closer to him.  Maybe leaving an
intriguing enough message would merit a callback.

I would do it.  Lately the few times I've played I've just been doing the
same things and not really finding anything new about the game. 

Is there a more suitable number to call?  Anybody have a number that might
work?

Does anyone know where I might find an arcade (pub, or whatever)
in the Boston area that has SMASH TV.  I haven't played for about
a month and wanted to play a few games, but 1001 Games (on Mass. Ave
near Harvard Square) no longer has the game!  This was the only
SMASH TV game that I have seen in the area, but there must be
many more?

Thanks in advance,
Vince

I just finished the game for the first time on 1 coin.  Played 2-player
for most of the way (from the beginning of stage 2).

Some more stuff that might be good to know.

It seems that the secret warp #3 is a error recovery system.  I saw
someone playing, move the machine out, and hit the side hard at the
start of Scarface and activate the warp.  I've also saw the game reset
after someone did that.  (this is not recommended: You lose bonus points,
may lose the game, and may be thrown out of the arcade.)

It seems that the way to beat Scarface is that you have to blow away his
face AND destroy all the armor around his head.  This seems to hold for
both times. (Check that you are doing damage == getting points).

Like in Punch-Out, the Cobra Bosses' eyes change yellow before they attack.

Does anyone have a complete collection of hints for
smash TV? (Where/what are the warps, how
do you use the doors that stay open longer,
what are the secret rooms, how do
you enter the key rooms, how do you enter the

  NEED lots of keys????

  How many??  a couple thousand?? Sounds impossible to me.

first of all the most I figure you could get is around 10 going through
the game and another 50-60 in the bonus room...

Ive gotten this many and yet was only allowed to got to room #2, like
always....

   Ill try to get no keys and see if it doesnt let me go to room #1,
that should clinch it.

I finally finished Smash T.v. Now the question is, how do you
get into the Pleasuredome? I know there was a thread recently
on this topic, I've only seen the messages pertaining to which
revision motherboard supports the pleasure dome. I missed the
ones discussing how to get in it. If someone could refer me
to those messages (if they exist), or email me a summary
I'd appreciate it.

I also have a few questions i was curious about:
1. Does picking up the surprise packages have any relation to
	the frequency which special weapons appear?
2. what do keys do? I presume it has something to do with
	finding the pleasure dome?
3. How far have people gone in one player mode? I was able to
	finish the game on 3$ playing with someone about my
	ability level.

I used to be able to get to Scarface, or the room preceeding him,
fairly regularily by myself on a single quarter.  Now, though, I
have more troubles, partially because our arcade brought
Tetris back (580,000 on a quarter the other day, level 41, I think!),
but also because it's gotten too easy.  Now, I'll sometimes get tanks
in the third room on the first level, and almost always in the
fourth one (pretty much regardless of which path I take).  This makes
it way too hard, so I don't get so far anymore . . .

I think I might have just pieced something together.  On the v5.00 they
have here (I told them to upgrade, but these people are SO SLOW to get
anything fixed unless the machine is unplayable) I grabbed two keys, and
then a whole bunch in "Share My Wealth" (bonus keys room).  I was able to
get to Secret Room #2.  This seems to confirm my theory that, on that
machine, the $ bonus rooms don't do jack s__t for your bonus.  Of all
those keys I grabbed, nothing came of it.  I have a feeling the same is
for all those presents they give you.  Immediate points, and that's all.

On one instance was I able to get up to room #6, and I was ALTERNATING
players each time I died, if no-one was joining in, and the timer had
definitely run out.  There may be gratis keys for someone joining in so
close to the end.

And so far, I have not found the place where the image shown in the lower
right corner of one of the demo's screens appears... you know, the one
with the woman with the robotic arm and bared breasts?

A friend and I recently pumped a small fortune into this game only
to finish without finding the 'pleasure dome'.  During the game (a
few screens after killing mutoid man) we "warped" or something like
that ... I remember seeing something like "???..level 3".  We managed
to skip scarface all together.  Anyway we went on to finish the game
... killing the host of Smash TV.  Is there a such thing as the 
"Pleasure Dome"?  If so, how does one get there?  How and why did we warp?  

Any information on this game would be most appreciated.
(NOOOOO   WAAAAAAAAY  !!!!!!!) - mutoid man

Thanks.

I am happy to say that the new ROM version of Smash TV has FINALLY arrived
at the UN-L Student Union in Lincoln, NE.  There is something that will
tell you if it is the new ROM without having to turn off the machine...
the second room on the first level now says "COLLECT 10 KEYS", instead of
just "COLLECT KEYS".

Please, PLEASE, if you must follow-up to this message, include a control-L
in the 0th column for others.  I am including extra blank lines, another

scrolling, look back and not have anything spoiled for them if they
accidentally started reading this message.

























I played it to the end ($3.75... I gotta improve that), taking the
northernmost paths on every room, going for the $ rooms, and especially
the "SHARE MY WEALTH" room which gives all those keys.  After the "COBRA
DEATH" room, where you kill the two mechanical cobras, I was let into the
room which was formerly entitled "YOU MAY NOW ENTER KEY ROOM #1".  This
time it said "YOU ALMOST HAVE ENOUGH KEYS".

After laying waste to all life forms and other entities in that room, I
went through the only exit, the usual one to the right.  Instead of the
name "YOU MAY NOW ENTER KEY ROOM #2" it said "YOU HAVE ENOUGH KEYS".  That
room is very hard and VERY LONG.  I managed to pick up some keys in that
room, but they seemed to appear after I had to put in another coin.

After spending several quarters in that room, I finally killed everything,
and then the doors opened.  That's right, plural.  One to the right as
usual, and another going down.  From my experience with the previous
version where taking the one to the right (which was the only one) led me
to the MC room, entitled "EAT MY EYEBALLS", I instead took the south
path...

There I was presented with a room entitled "OUTER PLEASURE DOME AREA" and
was presented with a large number of prizes, similar to the one after the
MC... except that these prizes were WOMEN, not packages.  I didn't know
how many groups of ladies I picked up, but just after the last batch
appeared, some more (what I call) Star Trek rejects came out (they do come
in green and red), who I had to kill.  Meanwhile the floor was pulsating
with color (as was the room I just left while I went through the door).

A door opened, this time to the north.  This is the only time I ever saw
the machine open a door back to a room I had already been in.  Going
through the door printed text, listing who I had killed, having the right
keys, saying I was awsome (!) and telling me I was going to kill the evil
MC, which I did, and was presented with the usual gifts afterward.

Scoring proceeded as normal (including the second player's scoreboard
saying that another player was needed, asking someone to join in (AT THE
END OF THE GAME?!?)).  I think the women and other special $ rooms add to
your score immediately, and don't get appended to the score that is given
at the end of a level.

The end game was the usual scrolling text, but it didn't say anything
about my not doing everything; everything was praise.  It seemed to go by
faster than usual, but that may be due to the lower amount of text it
scrolled (i.e. not stating that I had not reached the highest level of
competition).

I still don't have any definite idea about what would have happened if I
went east instead of south in that second room.  It may be random, only
more game playing would answer that.

Of what I saw, it didn't seem too exciting to me.

























Now, how about splitting this newsgroup into rec.games.video.home,
rec.games.video.arcade, and (if it those that gripe insist)
rec.games.video.misc?  Kill files are not sufficient.

One day a friend and I were playing a regular game of Smash TV when we got to
"Mutoid Man".  We began to grab the nearest weapons and started blasting away
at him, when the screen suddenly froze and to distort.  I thought it was a
brown out, but the other video games around seem to be unaffected.  Then we
noticed a message at the top of the screen.  It said we had activated "Warp 3"
and sent us to the next confrontation.  We've tried to activate the "warp" on
different occasions without success.  Does have a list or know how to activate
these "warps"?

Yes.  Cause an error.  The warp is an error recovery device.  One poster
remarked that he could cause the warp by effectively "tilting" the
machine.  This however is not suggested, as it may affect whether you are
allowed to play games at that location again.

Its hard to believe that, after all the questions about the Pleasure Dome,
when the version of the machine that has it comes out, no-one remarks
about it.  Probably because it has all the signs of not what the game
designer's had in mind originally.  Where were the ladies "promoting" you?
Just a bunch of meaningless prizes.  Still no sign of the image that was
depicted in the lower right corner of the demo screen:  woman with
cybernetic (?) arm with breasts bared.  This may have been the reason the
Pleasure Dome was held back so long, ala the reason one rarely gets to
finish the game Dragon's Lair in your average arcade.

Or did I get to the wrong room?

  You got to the pleasure dome???

  Id like to plant the guy at williams who pulled the little stunt of 
not "allowing" players to get to the pleasure dome until they install
the new version.  IVE YET TO SEE A GAME THAT HAS BEEN UPDATED. THUS I
spit on Smash tv games(just joking), never play it. And I HATE WILLIAMS!
I stinks, stinks...    

  GIMME pitfighter.

 As for pitfighter:  Being able to jam with TY, Ive started using BUZZ.
The strength guy, and have made quick progress. Ive found the best
attacks with buzz are to constantly roll and kick/punch. Dont attampt to
grab(its easily done to 
a few) since most are able to defend from it.
You get torn up trying to continually body slam people. Simply roll into
the enemy and fast/kick. kick works the best. Otherwise you get stunned
and punched. Ive only made it to the 4th round with buzz, while I can
consistantly get to the 10th round with ty and around 5 or 6 with kato.
Kato takes mucho damage from chainman...(uhhgg) 
Buzz jams in the grudge matches, knocks ty and kato right over.

later, mike

The way to get to the Pleasuredome is to get to the end of the game having
picked up "enough" keys (and taking the right turn ?).  Unfortunately, on
earlier versions of the game, you had to pick up an inordinate number of
keys (which seem to occur randomly).

This is supposed to have been fixed in version 8 of the ROMs.  You can
see the version number when the machine starts up.  The upgrade should be
free for registered owners from their distributors.  Unfortunately the
people who run the arcade around here are idiots and don't seem to
understand when I tell them.

I haven't personally gotten to the Pleasuredome (don't play much anymore),
haven't played anything later than version 5.

I've never taken the straight path, but I'm not sinking any more money
into it.

No, on earlier versions of the game it was NOT POSSIBLE.

Also in a ROM v8.00, the second room on the first level says "COLLECT 10
KEYS" whereas previously I think it said just "COLLECT KEYS".

From what I saw of it, the Pleasure Dome wasn't that great.  I still think

When I found out that only rev. 8 ROMs had it, I was pissed.  Still a
fun game, though.

Too bad they didn't do what they did with BLASTER.  When you reached
"Paradise" in BLASTER, you *knew it*.

On the other hand, at least they *released* SMASH TV.  It seems like
BLASTER got turned into about two dozen prototypes and then dropped.
A shame, since I think it's one of Williams' best games.

The real ending involved getting back out of the castle with the princess,
while her outfit gets more and more damaged, revealing more and more.

I think SMASH TV had a similar idea, from the image visible in the
lower-left corner of the screen during the demo.  The one where they show
the two contestants standing on a BIG pile of money, and a blue-tinted
border showing some scenes from the game.  The image in the lower left
corner did not appear in the game play at all.  Look closely and you'll
see the connection between the games.

As it is in ROM v8.00, there isn't much "pleasure" to the Pleasure Dome.
Big disappointment.

Possible spoilers follow:

Near the end, after COBRA DEATH, the first room afterward would say "YOU
ALMOST HAVE ENOUGH KEYS".  You go through yet another kill fest, then a
door opens to the right.  If you made it (I haven't missed it, but then
again I got to the end on the new ROM once, and haven't played it since)
it should say "YOU HAVE ENOUGH KEYS" and go through a very long kill fest,
where you will probably lose at least 5 lives, probably more.  Doors open
east and south.  I went through the south door from my memories of the
ending to v5.00 having the one to the east go right to the host.  Turns
out to be a pulsating colors room called "OUTER PLEASURE DOME AREA".
Picked up lots of posed women ala the $ rooms.  More "Star Trek Rejects"
came out to die (red and green shirts) and the north door opened.  No
others opened.
                                     o
The message you saw while playing 720  was the Warp message, which is an
error recovery device.  I don't know if it still exists in v8.00, but it
did in v5.00.  Sometimes though you can get errors that aren't trapped,
such as walking through some walls, getting caught in a area that's fenced
in over no floor, or fighting a frozen Scarface (face was blue).  (How
many tickets does your 720 degrees start out with?  First time I played
it, it gave 4 tickets, now all the ones I've seen start with only 1.)

I didn't seem to lose my keys with death, but it might have reduced them
by one each death.  Strangely enough, after dying and putting in a
quarter, I think I reliably saw one or two keys pop up not long after I
hit the credit button.  I put in plenty of quarters during that what was
called "Secret Key Room #2".

>Sheesh...
>Someone PUH-leez tell me....
>Thanky much.

I may be wrong on the precise names of the rooms, but I know you now need
only 10 keys (as opposed to the infinity keys required on older machines).

OK.

I'm going to try this just ONE MORE TIME.

How EXACTLY do you get to a Key Room or The Pleasure Dome in Smash TV?

If the version of the game does not have a PD, how do you get to a Key Room?

Exactly.

I do not care about Dragon's Lair and I would like to know where EXACTLY the
rooms are.  I don't care if your friend did it once or that "you need some
keys, I think".

I wanna know.

Really.

Please.

Thank you.

How many of you are thinking, "This is drugs... this is your brain on

>If the version of the game does not have a PD, how do you get to a Key Room?
>Exactly.

Sheesh, how many times do we have to go through this?  I posted this just
after I did it, and got ZERO response, and now we have all these people
clamoring to find out how instead of trying it themselves.  Its very
straightforward, and very difficult to miss.

It is after Cobra Death.  You know, the two big mechanical snakes?  If
after going through the door on the right after killing them you aren't
taken to another room, but instead went to the thing with counting points
(or taken to the host, I'm not sure on that, since I haven't failed to do
it right in a long time), you won't get to the Dome.

Warps are nothing but an error recovery device, and have little to no
bearing on any particular movement or backdoor in the game.

Collect (10) Keys:  This is how to tell if your game has the Dome or not.
If after going through the first door the room is entitled "COLLECT 10
KEYS" then you are on a Domed machine.  If it says anything else, no
Dome.

Either way, keys are important, and the most profitable paths are always
to the North.  On the last level, taking the North path will take you to a
room full of keys.  I suggest you do so, and grab as many as you can.

After the Cobras, when going through the door, an old machine will say
something like "You may enter key room #1."  A new one will say "You
almost have enough keys."  The next one will be "You may enter key room
#2" or "You have enough keys" or something if you don't have enough.
Don't ask me, I've always (i.e. once) had enough keys.  This room is the
most difficult, with the longest duration.

After that, I saw two exits, one to the East, the other South.  I chose
the South one and was presented with a pulsating room with lots of women
as prizes instead of gifts or keys.  I don't know what would have happened
if I took the East exit, but I suspect from other games on older machines
that it would take me to the host.

>-Jack-

That specific enough for you?

Hit return sometime, or set your right margin in vi or something!  People
don't like it when you have one continuous line.  Hit return before you
reach the edge of the screen.  Yes, this does require you to look at the
screen instead of your hands. :-)

Anyway, the Secret Key Warps are nothing but error recovery devices.
Unfortunately, you seem to have hit an error that didn't recover!  I would
have suggested running along all the walls with a shield, just in case an
enemy phased through a wall, like they occasionally do.  Orbs are
notorious for doing this.  However, I doubt you'll get a chance to repeat
this, just as I have been unable to recreate the circumstances which
presented me with Scarface being "frozen" (i.e. the color palettes got
mixed up and instead of being green, he was blue, with high contrast
between shades).

The Student Union arcade here just put in a game called Smash TV. I was 
wondering if any one out there has some tips, or can tell me where the room
is where you become a Grand Champion.  I finished the game but it said 
something about you are not a true champion because we didn't find this room.
Any clues or spoilers would be appreciated.  Thanks in advance.

I haven't spent any money in an arcade for a long time, mostly because
most of the games are the Ninja/kick-the-guy-in-the-face/Streetfighter
type (ho-hum).  However, on reading about SmashTV in this group, I thought
I'd give it a try, esp. since I'm an old Williams fan (Stargate and Joust,
my fav's).

Well, I spent a whole dollar on Smash TV, and I love it!  However, I only
got to the third level (and not on one quarter either ;).  Any of you
officianados want to give me your strategies?  Anything I should look for,
or make a point of killing/picking up/etc?  I'd like to master this game
with a little less money.

Thanks in advance,

If you really want to find out, find the switch on the top of the until.
Turn it off for a few seconds and then on again.  After the ROM check,
it will print the ROM revisioni at the top of the screen.  Hope
this helps.

Pick up keys; if your game displays "Collect 10 Keys" when you leave
the first room, it has a recent ROM rev. and thus the fabled "Pleasure
Dome".  I've yet to see it, but it's sure got to be better than the
older ROMs' ripoff ending.

Whenever you see an icon of a free man, pick it up.  Took me a while
to figure this out.

The bosses are best handled by staying above them; I suck on the snake
round, so don't ask me what to do there (beyond just putting more
quarters in).

If you're on the third wave after only a buck, you're doing much
better than I did when I first started.  On the higher levels, be sure
to stay near the middle of the floor and don't miss a weapon or you
are surely dead.  Don't let them back you into a corner (unless you're
playing two-player, in which case the corners are OK).

If you have a choice of shooting a green thug or a pink thug, shoot
the pink thug, since he's faster and smarter.  The greenies will
generally leave you alone unless they see you; the pink guys head
straight for you.

The money and prizes are totally meaningless, as is your score, which
is always pretty much related to what wave you're on.  Thanks for this
exciting innovation, Williams...

I still play every now and then, but I get frustrated by the end of
the third round, when billions of thugs pour out of doors non-stop.
At some point SMASH gets boring for me, where ROBOTRON never did.  I
don't know why, exactly, but I don't have the same desire to master
the game that I did with ROBOTRON.

The most effective strategy, though, is to have a handful of quarters
always at the ready...

That's because ROBOTRON was better!! It's incredible the lack of game
design that goes into today's games.  Sure, there's plenty of graphic
design, but there's no attention paid to making a fun game that will
challenge a player without frustrating or boring him/her.  And forget
about possibilities, todays games are so limited, players just learn
the "tricks" for each wave and say they've "mastered" the game!  The
worst part is that it's not going to get any better -- today's players
want gimmicks and that's what they get.  Well, that's enough raving for
now, I'm off to play some Race Drivin'...

     It's easy:
       1.  Insert another quarter
       2.  Play 60 more seconds
       3.  Repeat steps 1. and 2.

You must destroy the ring around Scarface, knock out his eyeballs and
several sets of teeth.  Then he'll become a skull.  Best way to get
him is to use the hoover (gun that shoots balls and sounds like a vacuume
cleaner) and hit his center.  If you don't have a hoover, work on his
perimeter.  Sections will flash when the section isn't destroyed yet.
This is a tough guy and it took my partner and I a while to get
past him on a regular basis.  If you've got a shield from grenades
or the hoover, try to protect your partner from the spike balls while
working on Scarface.

Not much better.  You get less text at the end with the right ending, and
nothing really "praising" your ability.

Just make sure you grab any and all shields and "Happy Feet" (what the
increased speed is called here).  Also, remember that for a few seconds
after you lose a shield you have "Limited Invinsibility", and can often
run straight through a crowd of enemies without a scratch.  Not too
successful when against end-level enemies.

Green and Pink Thugs?  Am I the only one who sees the resemblance to these

Don't forget that you can stand on his face while you have a shield, if
you can corner him.  Often easiest to do when one player is holding him
steady with gunfire and you come back into the game.

	It's easy:
	  1.  Insert another quarter
	  2.  Play 60 more seconds
	  3.  Repeat steps 1. and 2.
	  4.  Repeat steps 1. and 2.

Yes, this is my favorite way, and best of all -- you can't lose!

But just the other day I saw someone play Scarface without dying once.
It wasn't clear what he was doing (that I don't do, since I've never
played Scarface without dying at least one time); it looked like he
might have been playing closer to Scarface than I normally would.  In
fact, he never seemed to even *try* to avoid those yellow blobs or the
spinning spikies -- he just stood fairly close and blasted away.  He
also picked up nearly all the weapons, but I always try to do that
myself. 

I *know* you should play Mutoid Man from the top and corners; perhaps
you should play Scarface up close.  It's a thought, anyway.

In playing Smash TV, on the third level we have found two rooms, the first
says "You may enter Key room #1", the second "You may enter Key room #2".

How do you get into these rooms?  We've tried everything....

I haven't spent any money in an arcade for a long time, mostly because
most of the games are the Ninja/kick-the-guy-in-the-face/Streetfighter
type (ho-hum).  However, on reading about SmashTV in this group, I thought
I'd give it a try, esp. since I'm an old Williams fan (Stargate and Joust,
my fav's).

Well, I spent a whole dollar on Smash TV, and I love it!  However, I only
got to the third level (and not on one quarter either ;).  Any of you
officianados want to give me your strategies?  Anything I should look for,
or make a point of killing/picking up/etc?  I'd like to master this game
with a little less money.

Thanks in advance,

If you really want to find out, find the switch on the top of the until.
Turn it off for a few seconds and then on again.  After the ROM check,
it will print the ROM revisioni at the top of the screen.  Hope
this helps.

Pick up keys; if your game displays "Collect 10 Keys" when you leave
the first room, it has a recent ROM rev. and thus the fabled "Pleasure
Dome".  I've yet to see it, but it's sure got to be better than the
older ROMs' ripoff ending.

Whenever you see an icon of a free man, pick it up.  Took me a while
to figure this out.

The bosses are best handled by staying above them; I suck on the snake
round, so don't ask me what to do there (beyond just putting more
quarters in).

If you're on the third wave after only a buck, you're doing much
better than I did when I first started.  On the higher levels, be sure
to stay near the middle of the floor and don't miss a weapon or you
are surely dead.  Don't let them back you into a corner (unless you're
playing two-player, in which case the corners are OK).

If you have a choice of shooting a green thug or a pink thug, shoot
the pink thug, since he's faster and smarter.  The greenies will
generally leave you alone unless they see you; the pink guys head
straight for you.

The money and prizes are totally meaningless, as is your score, which
is always pretty much related to what wave you're on.  Thanks for this
exciting innovation, Williams...

I still play every now and then, but I get frustrated by the end of
the third round, when billions of thugs pour out of doors non-stop.
At some point SMASH gets boring for me, where ROBOTRON never did.  I
don't know why, exactly, but I don't have the same desire to master
the game that I did with ROBOTRON.

The most effective strategy, though, is to have a handful of quarters
always at the ready...

That's because ROBOTRON was better!! It's incredible the lack of game
design that goes into today's games.  Sure, there's plenty of graphic

challenge a player without frustrating or boring him/her.  And forget

I realize this will seem basic too all of you experts, but how do you
kill Scarface in at the end of the second round? He just tramples me

     It's easy:
       1.  Insert another quarter
       2.  Play 60 more seconds
       3.  Repeat steps 1. and 2.
       4.  Repeat steps 1. and 2.
       5.  Repeat steps 1. and 2.

You must destroy the ring around Scarface, knock out his eyeballs and
several sets of teeth.  Then he'll become a skull.  Best way to get
him is to use the hoover (gun that shoots balls and sounds like a vacuume
cleaner) and hit his center.  If you don't have a hoover, work on his
perimeter.  Sections will flash when the section isn't destroyed yet.
This is a tough guy and it took my partner and I a while to get
past him on a regular basis.  If you've got a shield from grenades
or the hoover, try to protect your partner from the spike balls while
working on Scarface.

Not much better.  You get less text at the end with the right ending, and
nothing really "praising" your ability.

Just make sure you grab any and all shields and "Happy Feet" (what the
increased speed is called here).  Also, remember that for a few seconds
after you lose a shield you have "Limited Invinsibility", and can often
run straight through a crowd of enemies without a scratch.  Not too
successful when against end-level enemies.

Green and Pink Thugs?  Am I the only one who sees the resemblance to these
foes to Green and Red Shirts from Star Trek (the old series)?

Don't forget that you can stand on his face while you have a shield, if
you can corner him.  Often easiest to do when one player is holding him
steady with gunfire and you come back into the game.

Yes, this is my favorite way, and best of all -- you can't lose!

But just the other day I saw someone play Scarface without dying once.
It wasn't clear what he was doing (that I don't do, since I've never
played Scarface without dying at least one time); it looked like he
might have been playing closer to Scarface than I normally would.  In
fact, he never seemed to even *try* to avoid those yellow blobs or the
spinning spikies -- he just stood fairly close and blasted away.  He
also picked up nearly all the weapons, but I always try to do that
myself. 

I *know* you should play Mutoid Man from the top and corners; perhaps
you should play Scarface up close.  It's a thought, anyway.

How do you get into these rooms?  We've tried everything....

The best way I have heard to know if the pleasure dome exists in the
model of Smash TV you are playing is if the game says "Dude!" when you
grab the symbol for an extra player.

So if the game says "Dude!", is there a pleasure dome or not?

No, I know of two games, one with the Dome, one without.  Both say the
same thing when you get a life.

BTW, I always thought it said "Damn!" in a happy sense.  Sounds like more

Yeah, so, I love this game still, and tonight, thanks to some luck,
and a guy with a pile o' tokens, we managed to make to the 3rd level.
Taking out the Mutoid Man is a blast.  At the end of level two we had
to take out Scarface, and I'll be damned if this didn't work and sound
almost exactly like Sinistar.  (ah, the memories...) At the third level
there were rooms on the map that had dollar signs marking them on the 
map, I guess this is where the keys come in.  We didn't pursue it tho',
cuz that requires thought, and we were heavily into the blasting the
shit out everything left and right.  Fun as hell!  At the end of the
third level there were these two huge snake things, and you could go
under them, but not the heads.  We ran out of tokens, however, and 
didn't get to kill them, darn.  But as I died and my partner kept
going, the first snake really spazzed out, swing all over the screen.

Really intense!  Someday, I'll just bring $10 in tokens or so.

I noticed that since about 1985 almost every video game in existence has the
'10 seconds to insert another coin and continue where you left off' feature.
My question is, exactly how much do you guys spend on continues with a fun
game?  I've seen people put a LOT of money into Smash TV (twenty or thirty
dollars of tokens at least) in one sitting.  I rarely use continue features,
though.  The upshot of this philosophy is being able to destroy Mutoid Man
and get halfway to Scarface before being utterly overwhelmed.  How about
the pros out there?

By the way, whatever pointers exist about playing Smash TV exist would be
extremely helpful to me.  It's an addictive game, but not worth dying every
thirty seconds in the later waves...
My own are pretty obvious: accurate fire (and lots of it), keep moving,
remember where the mines are, get speed as often as possible, don't let the
double shot ball touch an enemy, and ignore the presents and money!  As for
killing Mutoid Man I just sit in the upper corners where he can't hit me with
eyebeams and wait for a weapon to come by.  Oh yes, it's fun to *just* brush
by a batsman and leave him swinging at thin air...you can cut much closer to
them than you think.

I've finished the game on one quarter playing doubles with my friend.  He
finished in three quarters.  No, the game is not on an easy setting, we've
just been practicing for 7 months.  We routinely get to Diecobras (end
of the 3rd level) on one quarter each.  We're getting better at those
giant snakes, and I think soon we'll be getting past them every time.
We have ROM revision 4.0, but the owners are getting an upgrade from
Williams.  My previous experience was Robotron.  I played the game
on an Apple ][E, and I almost finished level 99 several times.

On the harder levels, stick to the corners that are directly accross from
each other (horiz or vert, not diags).  This lets you help each other out
when hordes of guys are stampeeding one corner.  Play as a team, and let
each other get weapons and extra guys.  Remember, 9 guys at one time is
the most that you can have.  If you have 9 guys and pick one up, it is
a wasted guy!  On orb levels, stay in the same corner.  This keeps you
from sending orbs accross the screen at your partner.  This game is
mostly skill and teamwork.  There aren't a lot of "if you do this, he
dies instantly" secrets.  Most people die because they're not a team,
they're two people competing for the same resouces.  I don't like to
play with such people.  One last hint: I think the best way to kill the
Diecobras is to stick together.  It usually puts out an orbital or two
that one player can use to take out the spiked balls.  Let me know if you
have any clues.

Please email me on how far you can get on one quarter doubles.  There must
be other people who come close to finishing without pumping.

This is my second try on getting some hints/tips/cheats on the arcade
game Smash T.V.  I can finish the game easily.  But I have not
found the "Pleasure Dome" that it talks about.  How do I get to it?
And what are "Secret Keys"?  I have found then only twice in my hundreds
of games played.

Am I the only Smash T.V. player here or what? ;)

Thanks.

The warp is an error recovery device.  (This should be in a FAQ by now.)
One player said they could warp by hitting the side of the cabinet hard.

Yeah, it does make a difference.  That version does not have the ending.
The upgrade is supposedly free, but I've found one place that would not
upgrade.

To the person who said the ending was great, either you have a different
rating system than I, or perhaps a newer version, or I should have gone
East instead of South in that last room.  I still haven't found where
that one image during the demo mode (lower right corner in blue) is
shown.
